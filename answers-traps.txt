Q&A

1.Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

a0 a1 a2. a2.

2.Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

没有地方调用，被内联了.

3.At what address is the function printf located?

0000000000000630

4.What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

38

5.Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

HE110 World. 不需要修改i. 不需要修改57616.

6.In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

会打出寄存器a2的值.
